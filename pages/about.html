            <h3>About me:</h3>
            <p>
                Hello there!

                I'm Petter Tjärnås Liljedahl, a 32-year-old dude with a knack for all things social. 
                I mean, seriously, what could be better than working in a field where I can flex my social 
                and service-oriented muscles to charm customers, contacts, and partners? 
                Right now, I'm rockin' the title of Project Manager, which comes with a wild mix of tasks. 
                Picture me as a <abbr title="Private Branch eXchange">PBX</abbr> maestro, crafting PBX solutions for businesses while also 
                providing kickass support to get those solutions up and running smoothly. And let's not forget my 
                superhero talent for troubleshooting within Mitel's switchboard platform. 
                I decipher all the tech jargon and make sure necessary actions are taken. 
                Oh, and as a bonus, I'm the official transcriber of mind-blowing info between operators and 
                customers, revealing the secrets of useful features. If you ask my current and former colleagues, 
                they'd say I'm a wizard when it comes to solving problems. I've got top-tier organizational skills and 
                can lead a team like nobody's business. I've been honing my leadership and development chops for six years at 
                DSTNY SE (formerly known as Soluno BC). Plus, I'm socially committed and have English skills 
                that would put Shakespeare to shame. But wait, there's more! 
                I'm not just outgoing; I'm a magnet for new connections. 
                Need someone who takes charge and gets things done? That's me, your go-to action hero. 
                I take the initiative and solve problems like a boss, no sidekick needed. So, there you have it!

                I feel like it's time to take a little detour into the realm of laughter.

                Picture this: Tom Segura, the hilarious comedian extraordinaire, takes on none other than Steven Seagal, 
                the action star with a ponytail that defies gravity. Trust me, this clip is pure gold. <small>please laugh.</small>
